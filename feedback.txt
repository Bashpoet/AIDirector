Here are some detailed suggestions, comments, and areas to explore further:

Code Structure & Functionality
Model Abstraction:

Consider adding an interface or abstract base class (ABC) for ModelConfig to enforce method implementation consistency. This would improve maintainability when adding new models.
Logging Enhancements:

Add support for different logging levels (info, debug, error) with the standard logging module instead of manual file writes. This would make logs more scalable and easier to manage.
Environment Loading:

Consider centralizing the environment variable loading logic. load_dotenv() is currently buried in ModelRegistry; moving it to the main execution file would improve visibility.
Error Handling:

The ResponseGenerator's generate_response() method could include more granular exception handling per provider, returning helpful error messages if APIs are down or if rate limits are exceeded.

Future Features to Consider
Advanced Memory Module:

Implement a memory component beyond conversation history, perhaps based on vector embeddings for long-term context retention.
Dynamic Orchestration Logic:

Add adaptive orchestration, where models "vote" on the next-best response, enhancing multi-model decision-making.
Custom Model Expansion API:

Provide a developer-facing API for easy custom model integration by third-party developers.
