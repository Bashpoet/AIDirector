Acknowledgements
This project would not have been possible without the support of the open-source community and the following key technologies and platforms:

OpenAI API – For enabling GPT-4’s powerful language generation capabilities.
Anthropic API – For integrating Claude's thoughtful AI responses.
Python Standard Library – The solid foundation on which much of the system’s core functionality rests.
Community Contributions – Special thanks to open-source developers and contributors who inspire technical creativity and philosophical exploration.
The developers acknowledge that AI systems are built on the collective efforts of countless researchers, engineers, and thinkers. This project is a tribute to the synthesis of human ingenuity and artificial potential.
